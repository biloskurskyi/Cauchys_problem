# Cauchys_problem   
  
This code solves the Cauchy problem for ordinary differential equations and systems.  
  
To do this, we can use the following 5 methods: general scheme of numerical methods for solving Cauchy problems,    
Euler's method with refinement, 4th order Runge-Kutta method, Adams extrapolation method, Adams interpolation method.
